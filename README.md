# devsecops-aws-services
DevSecOps pipeline demo with Apache code using AWS native services (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline). Includes two different pipelines:

1. Application scanning pipeline - built to scan vulnerable web applications using Trufflehog and OWASP Dependency Checker.
2. Infrastructure as code pipeline - built to scan infrastructure-as-code deployment templates written in Terraform.
